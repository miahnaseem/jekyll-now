title: First Blog Post

After cloing Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now Repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), I have created my first blog post with it. This was written as an exercise for a Data Science Bootcamp. We are wrapping up, with less than one week to go, and it's an appropriate time to learn how to create and use our ever important portfolios. I look forwards to the writing I'll be posting here or my personal site!
